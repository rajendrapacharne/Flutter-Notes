To set up Flutter, install an emulator, set up Visual Studio Code (VSCode), and Git for learning Dart, you can follow these text-based steps:

1. **Install Git:**

   - Download Git for your platform from the official website: [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your platform.

2. **Install Flutter:**

   - Download the Flutter SDK for your platform from the official Flutter website: [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
   - Extract the downloaded package to a directory of your choice.
   - Add the Flutter `bin` directory to your system's `PATH` environment variable to access Flutter commands globally.

3. **Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode):**

   - Download VSCode from the official website: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your platform.
   - Open VSCode.

4. **Install Flutter Extension for VSCode:**

   - Open VSCode.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
   - Search for "Flutter" in the Extensions view search bar.
   - Click "Install" on the official Flutter extension provided by the Flutter team.

5. **Install Android Emulator:**

   - Install Android Studio (not mandatory but provides an easy way to set up an emulator). Download it from the official website: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
   - Open Android Studio and follow the on-screen instructions to install the Android SDK and related components.
   - Create an Android Virtual Device (AVD) through Android Studio's AVD Manager to set up an Android emulator.

6. **Verify Flutter Installation:**

   - Open a terminal.
   - Run `flutter doctor` to check the status of your Flutter installation and to see if there are any additional setup steps needed.

7. **Create a Flutter Project:**

   - In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to create your Flutter project.
   - Run `flutter create project_name` to create a new Flutter project.

8. **Run Your Flutter App:**

   - Use the emulator you set up or connect a physical device.
   - Navigate to your Flutter project directory in the terminal.
   - Run `flutter run` to build and launch your Flutter app on the selected device/emulator.

9. **Start Learning Dart and Flutter:**

   - You can start learning Dart and Flutter by following official documentation, online tutorials, and courses. Here are some resources:
     - [Dart Language Tour](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour)
     - [Flutter Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs)
     - [Flutter Codelabs](https://flutter.dev/docs/codelabs)

These steps should help you set up Flutter, an emulator, VSCode, and Git for learning Dart and Flutter development. Remember to regularly update your Flutter SDK and VSCode extensions for the best development experience.
